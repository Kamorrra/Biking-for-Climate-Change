**PROJECT BRIEF**

Shawn is opening a new Pizzeria in his hometown of London. Shawn has asked us to create a bespoke relational database for his business that will allow him to **capture and store** important data that the business generates. This will allow Shawn to monitor business performance.

There are **3 main areas** that we have been asked to concentrate on
- Customer Orders
- Stock Control
- Staff

Below are the steps i've taken to complete these task for Shawn's business, and the tools I've used throughout the project

------------------------------

**TOOLSET**

- QuickDBD
- Excel
- SQL
- Tableau

------------------------------

**CREATING THE DATABASE**

Through the use of Quick DBD, I was able to create a visualize a database for Shawn's business that targets our required areas of interest

Visible in the diagram, some tables within the database have similar fields and will be connected/joined via those primary and foreign keys in our SQL queries later in the project.
